answer: line58-61
discussion about the results: To find the places in the World where there have not yet been more than 10 total infections as of 31 March. I filter the countries that has its total cases no more than 10 at the date of 31 March, 2020.
Then I filter the columns that show the name of countries and the total infections.
To do this, I use the Boolean to show that if the date is '2020-03-31', then it is defined as True, which will be showed.
Then I filter in the 'date', which shows all the data on 31 March, to define the locations where its total cases is no more than 10 as True.
As a result, the 'countries' will show all the data with its total cases no more than 10 on 31 March.
In the end, I filter the columns that show its locations and total cases.
