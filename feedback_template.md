## Please do the following:

- [ ] Add this file to your GitHub fork of IBI1_2018-19. You are allowed to delete the last line (giving your score) before uploading the file to GitHub, if you do not want others to see it. 
- [ ] Make changes to your code from weeks 3 to 5 according to the feedback below. This will form part of your summative assessment. (You may use the checkboxes to keep track of your progress) 


## Feedback:
For week4, there is no change to make.

For week5, when comparing d with e, I did the comparison but only with d<=e. So I added the description that if d<=e, then print 'd is not greater than e'. And if not, then print 'd is greater than e'.
The mysterious code task needs to import number that is smaller than 50 at random. At first I forgot the situation when the number imported equals to 50. So I correct the code to 'if n >=50'.
In the r_rate task, I only calculated the new infected number. I correct the code by adding the initial infection and get the total infection number.

For week6, I forgot to add the title of the pie chart. So I add the code "plt.title('Comparing coronavirus infection rates across countries')" to show the title.

Through those tasks, I learn to put the knowledge in lectures into practical. 'Practice makes the perfect.' By writing the codes and correcting them, I have the chance to practice my coding skills.
