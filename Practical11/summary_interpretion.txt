The results show that the alignment score between the sequence of human and mouse is 1091 and The percentage of 
identical amino acids is approximately equals to 89.7%. The alignment score between the sequences of human and random
is -250, the same as the alignment score between the sequences of mouse and random. The percentage of identical amino 
acids between human and random sequence is approximately equals to 5.8% while between mouse and random sequence, it is
approximately equals to 6.3%.

From these data, we see that the alignment score between the sequence of human and mouse and the percentage of identical 
amino acid is overall high. The reason of it may be that we human and mouse are all mammals. We have a lot in common limbs,
 similar digestive systems, similar reproductive mechanisms and so on. In addition, the human, the mouse and many other 
 mammals had a same ancestor in the history of evolution.
